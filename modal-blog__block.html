      <h2>Replicant – The Future of Customer Service</h2>
      <div class="modal-date">Published September 26, 2020</div>
      <p>When we started Replicant in 2017, we certainly did not predict that a global pandemic
        would create a customer service disaster, suddenly accelerating businesses into AI and
        automation. We “merely” believed that machines were ready to have useful, complex
        conversations with people and that the future business applications of this could be
        profound.</p>

      <p>We look around us today (while living in a dystopian scene from our namesake film) and
        know the world has turned upside down over the past six months. For businesses — call
        centers have shut down due to Covid-19, customer service call volumes have surged
        unpredictability, and customers are more frustrated than ever with long wait times
        leading to unresolved issues. Replicant’s autonomous call center is now enabling these
        businesses to fully resolve customer issues (even the most complex ones) over the phone
        with natural-sounding conversations — improving the customer experience while reducing
        costs.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of millions of consumers use voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa or Apple’s
        Siri for simple tasks in their daily lives. Now, one company wants to take talking bots
        to the next level: the highly conversational field of customer service.</p>

      <p>Replicant, named after Blade Runner’s genetically engineering humans, is entering
        uncharted territory with its software…</p>
      — Forbes

      <p>Startups have moments. Replicant’s is now. The company is now handling over two million
        autonomous customer support calls a month, grown over 15X in revenue in just six months,
        and is partnering with some of the largest enterprises and call centers in the world.
        We’re inspired by how this incredible team, led by our co-founders Gadi Shamia (CEO) and
        Benjamin Gleitzman (CTO), have fearlessly seized their moment during this pandemic to
        help businesses and customers across the globe.</p>

      <p>We’re excited to share today that with Replicant, Atomic has made one of our most
        significant investments in any company to-date, and partnered with Scott Beechuk at
        Norwest Venture Partners who led a $27 million investment in the company, alongside a
        group of co-investors deeply experienced with the intersection of AI and the enterprise:
        Mark Selcow at Costanoa Ventures, James Cham at Bloomberg Beta, and State Farm Ventures.
        Scott, who is intimately familiar with the customer service software industry from his
        time as SVP Product for Salesforce Service Cloud points out why Replicant is well
        positioned:</p>

      <p>(Replicant’s) attention to this humanscale connection is what sets them apart in the
        customer service arena: they start with the experience between caller and agent and
        build their AI-driven product around it. The result is a first-of-its-kind product that
        honors the human aspect of customer service no matter how automated operations get.</p>


      <p>The company has come a long way from its humble beginnings converting our storage
        closet into a closely guarded private office where Benjamin Gleitzman’s hand-picked team
        of AI and machine learning engineers started building the world’s first autonomous call
        center. But we know this is just the beginning and couldn’t be more hopeful about the
        future of customer service.</p>
